\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a sequential and dynamic process for the challenging problem of object detection and segmentation. This process can iteratively selects a context related question adapting to different query and responses from previous questions, then more accurately refines the search area or rejects the object early without running many detectors, thus it can significantly reduce the computational cost while preserving good accuracy for the target. We are formulate the object detection problem as a Markov Decision Process, and learn a policy using imitation learning to control this process. We present a unified probabilistic framework to model spatial context between objects. We applied this active detection scheme to the problem of object detection and segmentation, and achieved comparable or even higher average precision with significant computational savings.

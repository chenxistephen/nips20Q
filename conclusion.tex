\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a sequential and dynamic process for object detection and segmentation, in which a policy iteratively selects a context related question adapting to different query and responses from previous context-related questions, then more accurately refines the search area or rejects the object early without running many detectors. Thus it can significantly reduce computational cost while preserving good accuracy for the query class. We formulate the object detection problem as a Markov Decision Process to learn a policy by imitation learning. We present a unified probabilistic framework to model spatial context between objects. We applied this active detection scheme to the problem of object detection and segmentation, and achieved comparable or even higher average precision compared to previous approaches, but with significant computational savings.

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose a new strategy for simultaneous object detection and segmentation. Instead of evaluating all object detectors at all possible locations in the
image, we develop a divide-and-conquer approach by sequentially posing questions about the query and its related context---like playing a ``Twenty Questions'' game---to decide where to search for the object. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and learn a search policy by imitation learning. At each step, the policy dynamically selects a question based on the query, the scene and observed responses given by object detectors evaluated so far.
Experimental results show that our
algorithm reduces over 30\% of the object proposal evaluation with little loss in average precision compared to exhaustive search. 
Our learned policy also achieves better speed-accuracy tradeoff than the random search strategy.

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose a new strategy for simultaneous object detection and segmentation. Instead of evaluating classifiers for all possible locations of objects in the
image, we develop a divide-and-conquer approach by sequentially posing questions about the query and related context, like playing a ``Twenty Questions'' game, to decide where to search for the object. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and learn a policy using reinforcement learning that can dynamically select questions based on the query, the scene and current observed responses given by object detectors and classifiers. The algorithm reduces about 30\% of the object proposals evaluation while maintaining high average precision. Experiments show promising results compared with baselines of exhaustive search, searching for objects in random sequences and random locations.
